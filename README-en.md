## üìö About this repository

This repository contains exercises that I do to study the Go programming language. Each topic is organized in a separate directory, with the following elements:

### Repository Structure
1. **Statements**: Inside each directory, you will find a file called `enunciado.md` with a detailed description of the exercise. The statements are essential to understand the problem and the requirements.

2. **Code Solutions**: In addition, there is a directory called `solucoes`, where you can find my solutions for each exercise. Each solution is in a separate file with the `.go` extension. These files contain the source code of the solutions I developed.

### How to Test the Solutions

If you want to test any of the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Copy the code of the desired statement from the enunciado.md file.

2. Access the Go Playground.
  
3. Paste the code into the [Go Playground](htts;//go.dev/play) editor.

4. Click on the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button to execute the code and see the results. The Go Playground is an online tool that allows you to test and run Go code without having to install anything locally.

### Available Topics

Here are some topics you can explore in this repository:

- ‚úÖ **Variables Values and Types**: Practice with data types such as integers, floats, strings etc.
- ‚ùå **Control Flow**: Exercises related to conditional structures (if, for, switch).
- ‚ùå **Functions**: Exercises involving creation and use of functions.
